Welcome, Losers! 
Oh great, another sucker willing to waste their time contributing to this glorified pile of code we call a repository. Congrats on being dumb enough to think your input matters. Here’s how you can make yourself useful—or at least not completely useless. 
Code Style  

Listen up, nerd. You better follow the coding style already in place unless you want me to personally hunt you down and replace your brain with one that actually works. Consistency is key here—not because it’s noble, but because I don’t have time to decipher whatever garbage syntax you cooked up after binge-watching anime. 

If your code looks like it was written by Morty during his “edgy phase,” expect ridicule. And no, adding unnecessary semicolons or overusing emojis in comments won’t make you look cool—it’ll just make you look stupid. 
Documentation  

Oh boy, documentation—the part everyone hates but pretends to love. If you’re going to bother contributing, slap some half-decent comments into your spaghetti code so future contributors (or more likely, me) don’t lose their minds trying to figure out what you were thinking. 

Also, when writing your pull request description, keep it short and snarky. No one wants to read an essay about how proud you are of fixing a typo. Just tell us what you did and why it matters—if it even does. Bonus points if you insult someone else’s work while explaining yours. 
Testing  

Before submitting your precious little pull request, test your crap. Seriously. Don’t make me run your untested junk through my quantum debugger only to find out you broke everything worse than Unity’s physics engine. Write relevant test cases, ensure existing tests pass, and for crying out loud, don’t skip steps because you’re lazy. 

If your changes break something—and let’s be real, they probably will—I reserve the right to mock you mercilessly in front of the entire multiverse. Test twice, cry once. 
Issue Tracker  

Ah yes, the issue tracker—a black hole where good intentions go to die. Before diving headfirst into your next “brilliant” idea, check the tracker to see if anyone else has already started working on it. If they have, leave a passive-aggressive comment claiming their approach sucks and offering your superior solution. 

If there’s no issue listed for what you’re doing, create one—but only if you feel like wasting more time. Otherwise, just wing it and hope nobody notices until it’s too late. That’s how innovation happens, right? 
Code Review  

Congratulations, you’ve made it to the fun part: having your soul crushed by strangers who hate your guts. All contributions must survive the dreaded code review process, where people will rip apart your hard work faster than a Meeseeks solving a problem. 

Be prepared to take feedback like a champ—or at least pretend to care. If you argue back without substance, prepare for a verbal beatdown. Code reviews exist to maintain quality and consistency—not because we value teamwork, but because bad code makes my portal gun malfunction. 
Final Thoughts  

Thanks for your contribution, I guess. Your efforts might actually matter someday… or they might get overwritten five minutes later by someone smarter than you. Either way, pat yourself on the back for participating in this cosmic joke we call open-source development. 

Now get back to work, maggot. Wubba lubba dub-dub!
